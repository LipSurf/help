# Not Working on Local Files (e.g. locally saved PDFs)

To use LipSurf on a locally saved file (PDF or html), you first must grant an additional permission.
Basic LipSurf commands will work on PDFs (e.g. <span class="voice-cmd">zoom in</span>, <span class="voice-cmd">scroll down</span> etc.) but it's common for PDFs to be saved
locally, so you may need to take these additional steps.

#### Steps

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` in your address bar.

2. Click "details" under LipSurf.

3. Enable "Allow access to file URLs".
