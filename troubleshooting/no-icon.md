# No Icon

Sometimes Chrome will automatically hide extension icons. Here's how you can have the LipSurf icon show in the toolbar again:

1. Click the Chrome Menu (usually three dots "..." on the upper right of the window)

2. The LipSurf Icon should be at the top of the submenu

3. Right-click the icon and click "show in toolbar"

### If you don't see LipSurf there either...

Make sure it is installed and enabled in `chrome://extensions` (type this in the address bar)
