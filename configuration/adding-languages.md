# Adding Languages

Languages can be added and improved by anyone. 

## Change Language

Say the language name with LipSurf on (eg. <span class="voice-cmd">Japanese</span> or <span class="voice-cmd">Russian</span>) or change the language in the settings
(open settings by saying <span class="voice-cmd">options</span> or right clicking the extension icon and clicking "options").

## Add A New Language

Languages can be added incrementally. Since there are many commands, you can start with the most essential commands, and add the rest as you need them.

Simply make a post on the [forum](https://discuss.lipsurf.com) with the names of English commands and their translated versions.
Eg. [here's the post for Spanish](https://discuss.lipsurf.com/t/spanish-translation-help-appreciated/136).

### Tips

* If there's multiple ways to say something (eg. "scroll to top", "top of page", "top of the page") please include all the variations.
* To go the extra mile, make a pull request on [Github](https://github.com) including the necessary changes to the [community plugins](https://github.com/lipsurf/plugins).
