# Use a New Tab Other Than the LipSurf New Tab Page

::: warning NOTE
Due to Google Chrome security restrictions, LipSurf can't show the live transcript and not all LipSurf commands will work on Chrome's default new tab page, or on another extension's new tab page. To overcome these limitations, LipSurf has it's own "new tab" page which can also optionally load a URL.
:::

## Don't want the LipSurf "New Tab" Page?

Google Chrome will use the new tab page for the latest new tab extension installed. You can use a custom URL with LipSurf or you can use another extension's new tab page without uninstalling LipSurf.

### Use a Custom URL

1. Make sure "Use LipSurf on the new tab page" is on in the LipSurf options.

2. Open a new tab - there should be a gear in the lower left if LipSurf has control of the new tab page.

3. Click the gear icon.

4. Select "Use custom URL" and set the URL including the protocol (http://..., https://... etc.)

### Use a New "New Tab" Page Extension

1. Install the extension of the new tab page extension you want to use (after LipSurf is installed).

2. Google Chrome will now use the new tab page of the latest extension you just installed.

### Revert to a Previous "New Tab" Extension

If you had a new tab extension installed before LipSurf that you to revert the new tab to, simply install the new tab extension you want to use *after* you've installed LipSurf. Here are detailed steps:

1. First, make sure your data from the other new tab extension is backed up (either exported or stored online) to prevent losing data/settings for the other extension.
2. Once your data in the other extension (e.g. Momentum) is backed up, go to the URL `chrome://extensions` in Google Chrome.
3. Locate the other extension on the extensions page, then click the Remove button.
4. Go to the Chrome Web Store and search for the extension you just removed.
5. Reinstall the extension you want to use for the new tab.
6. Open a new tab. You should now see the other new tab extension there, and can continue to use all LipSurf commands on pages with normal `http://...` or `https://...` URLs (but commands are limited on the new tab page).
